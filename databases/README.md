### Relational Databases

Relational databases are based on the **relational model**, which organizes data into tables with rows and columns.

ACID: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability

:green_circle: Key features and benefits of relational databases include:

- `Structured data organization`: Data in relational databases is stored in tables with a predefined schema, enforcing a consistent structure throughout the database. This organization makes it easier to manage and maintain data, especially when dealing with large amounts of structured data.

- `Relationships and referential integrity`: The relationships between tables in a relational database are defined by primary and foreign keys, ensuring referential integrity. This feature allows for efficient querying of related data and supports complex data relationships.

- `SQL support`: Relational databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying, manipulating, and managing data. SQL is a powerful and widely adopted language that enables developers to perform complex queries and data manipulations.

- `Transactions and ACID properties`: Relational databases support transactions, which are sets of related operations that either succeed or fail as a whole. This feature ensures the ACID properties – Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability – are maintained, guaranteeing data consistency and integrity.

- `Indexing and optimization`: Relational databases offer various indexing techniques and query optimization strategies, which help improve query performance and reduce resource consumption.

:red_circle: Relational databases also have some drawbacks:

- `Limited scalability`: Scaling relational databases horizontally (adding more nodes) can be challenging, especially when compared to some NoSQL databases that are designed for distributed environments.

- `Rigidity`: The predefined schema in relational databases can make it difficult to adapt to changing requirements, as **altering the schema may require significant modifications** to existing data and applications.

- `Performance issues with large datasets`: As the volume of data grows, relational databases may experience performance issues, particularly when dealing with complex queries and large-scale data manipulations.

- `Inefficient for unstructured or semi-structured data`: Relational databases are designed for structured data, which may not be suitable for managing unstructured or semi-structured data, such as **social media data or sensor data**.
