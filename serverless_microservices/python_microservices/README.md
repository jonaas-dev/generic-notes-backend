## What are Microservices?

**What is a monolith?** All in the same places

Some parts of some project:

- Search (Traffic)
- Products List (Cached)
- Products Recommendation (ML)
- Contact (No Traffic)

:warning: Problems:

- Problem 1: we can scale this app, we can replicate all funcionalities
- Problem 2 : many languages and many teams (cause problems)
- ...

âœ… We can have many instance for cover "traffic" and one instance for Contact (no traffic)
